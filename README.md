# Docbook XSL for Sigplan

This repository holds the work on developing a Sigplan template for writing 
academic journal articles. The sigplan format is very popular, but there does 
not appear to be a readily available template for writing DocBook articles 
and using FO-XSL to directly convert them into a Sigplan article. 

Another alternative is to use the db2latex program to convert the DocBook 
document into a LaTeX file first and then to use the Sigplan LaTeX class file.
